## Analysis of Life Expectancy by Continent

 We hypothesize that life expectancy is a function of time and location. This analysis attempts to check that relationship. 
 
 **Note: this is a preliminary analysis and not meant for distribution to the public.**

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

 d <- readr::read_csv(here("data/gapminder/raw/gapminder_data.csv"))
library(tidyverse)
d%>%
  filter(continent=="Asia")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=pop, group=country, color=country))+
  geom_line()
ggplot(data=d) + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=pop, group=country, color=country))
```

## details
The data consists of years from `r range(d$year)`.
